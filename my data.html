<p style="color:purple;font-size: 30px;">Matter is everything around you. <span style="color: green;"> <mark> <u> <b>Atoms</u> </b> </u></span></mark> and compounds are all made of very small parts of matter. Those atoms go on to build the things you see and touch every day.</p>

	<p style="color: red;font-size: 30px;">What are the main states of matter? Everyone should know about <span style="color: green;font-size: 40px;"> <u> <mark>solids, liquids, gases, and plasmas.</mark></u></span>  Scientists have always known about solids, liquids, and gases. Plasma was a new idea when it was identified by William Crookes in <mark>1879.</mark> We also like to talk about the <span style="color: green; font-size: 40px;"> <u><mark>Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC).</mark></u></span>  Itâ€™s a fun state of matter when you remove almost all energy from a system. The scientists (Cornell, Ketterle, and Wieman) who worked with the Bose-Einstein condensate received a Nobel Prize for their work in <mark><b>2001.</b></mark> <span style="color: green;font-size: 35px;"><del>He died in 1896.</del></span>

<p style="color: red;font-size: 30px;">What is a physical change in matter? Molecules can move from one physical state to another <span style="color: green;"><mark>(phase change)</mark></span>  and not change their <span style="color:black;"> <mark> <b>atomic structure.</b> </mark></span> </b> Oxygen <b>(O<sub>2</sub>)</b> gas has the same chemical properties as liquid oxygen. The liquid state is colder and denser <mark> (less energy),</mark> but the molecules are the same. Water <b> <mark> (H<sub>2</sub>O)</b></mark> is another example.</p>
